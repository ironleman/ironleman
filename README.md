Hi there, Iâ€™m Simon Lemay ðŸ‘‹ 

Glad to have you here! ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=page.id)

I am primarily a back-end software engineer with an interest in video game development.

I love solving complex problems and helping others, thus I develop software that makes a difference in the world!

Personal Endeavors:
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making things in the virtual space,
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to develop C code to write to a complex chip,
- ðŸ“« <a href="https://devsimlem.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portolio!</a>
